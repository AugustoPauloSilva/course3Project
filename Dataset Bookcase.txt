1.	The method used to make the complete dataset was to
	append the data from test files on the train files. 
	The order of the data was not altered in any way, so
	this was the only step needed for the creation of the
	complete dataset.
2.	For the creation of the tidy dataset, it was necessary
	merge multiple files into a single dataframe. On the 
	first step, there was only the need to filter the desired 
	values from the X_complete.txt file. After this, it was 
	necessary to load the activities and features labels, 
	and insert them on the dataset. All the features were 
	loaded as column names before filtering out the unneded 
	values. The activity labels were converted into factors, 
	for readability.
